=======================

rebol-c-source.reb ultimately proved to heavy for the bootstrap process for building Rebol as was abandoned for this purpose in
favor of a simpler approach represented by the commits in [November 2015 to Ren/C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/761795bbc816d0e5676568ccbda59815df0f05ef#diff-d05249ee9c6bfa141ca086ede55f7b2b)
and separate sources added to the Ren/C Test framework. Logic developed in rebol-c-source.reb was reused for the these purposes.

I see no reason to maintain this.
